#Nightlight App

All code is found in the file notebooks/App.ipynb
interpolationlines.csv and storms_data.csv are both files required in running the programme. 

The Program currently runs on a platform called heroku the running programm can be accessed at :
https://nightlight-carribean.herokuapp.com/

I update the app by pushing to my github currently set to private: https://github.com/T0ddBlackburn/Nightlight_carribean_app and this automatically updates the app on heroku

all other files in this directory are there for heroku to run, I have largely copied them from example apps given by heroku
